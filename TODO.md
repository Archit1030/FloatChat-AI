# Frontend Deployment with Mock Data - TODO List

## Current Task: Deploy frontend on Streamlit with mock data

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Analyze project structure and components
- [x] Understand mock_data.py functionality
- [x] Create implementation plan
- [x] Get user approval for plan

### Pending Tasks:
- [ ] Create components/mock_data_provider.py
- [ ] Modify streamlit_app.py to use mock data provider
- [ ] Update components/data_manager.py for mock data support
- [ ] Test local Streamlit app execution
- [ ] Prepare for deployment (requirements, config)
- [ ] Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

### Notes:
- Mock data provider should generate in-memory data without database dependencies
- Ensure all data operations work with pandas DataFrames
- Maintain compatibility with existing component interfaces
